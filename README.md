Write More Human
AI Text Detector and Writing Improvement Platform

Write More Human is a next-generation writing intelligence platform designed to help writers evaluate, understand, and improve AI-assisted content. Instead of providing a simple AI-versus-human label, the platform delivers a deeper, multi-signal analysis and practical guidance to make writing clearer, more natural, and more authentic.

The goal is not just detection, but transformation.

What Makes Write More Human Different

Most AI detectors answer only one question: whether a text was written by AI. Write More Human focuses on a more useful problem — how to improve writing quality while preserving meaning, intent, and factual accuracy.

By combining AI detection with coaching, rewriting, grammar correction, and paraphrasing, the platform supports real-world writing workflows rather than one-off checks.

How the Platform Works

Write More Human evaluates text using multiple signals instead of relying on a single classifier. These signals include language model perplexity, AI probability scoring, sentence rhythm, lexical diversity, and readability variation. Together, they produce a Human-Likeness Score that reflects how naturally the text reads to a human audience.

The analysis is presented sentence by sentence, with clear explanations showing why specific lines feel predictable, generic, or overly polished.

Sentence-Level Coaching

Each sentence is evaluated individually and paired with targeted feedback. Writers receive concrete suggestions explaining how to improve clarity, variation, and natural flow. The goal is not only to fix the current text, but to help users develop stronger writing instincts over time.

Full-Text Human Rewrite

For users who want faster results, Write More Human offers a one-click rewrite of the entire document. The rewrite preserves facts and meaning while improving rhythm, variation, and tone. Users can control rewrite intensity, ranging from minimal refinement to stronger humanization, and immediately see how the Human-Likeness Score changes.

Grammar Correction with Transparency

Grammar correction is handled separately from humanization. The grammar tool fixes spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors without altering tone or style. Changes are visually highlighted at the word level so users can clearly see what was modified and why.

This ensures editorial transparency and avoids hidden rewrites.

Intelligent Paraphrasing

The platform includes structured paraphrasing modes that allow users to simplify, shorten, expand, formalize, or make text more conversational. Paraphrasing preserves original meaning and facts, making it suitable for professional, academic, and publishing use cases.

Document Support and Exports

Write More Human supports pasted text as well as uploaded documents, including TXT, PDF, and DOCX formats. Users can export results as professionally formatted DOCX, HTML, or JSON reports, making the tool suitable for collaboration, editing, and archiving workflows.

Intended Users

Write More Human is built for writers, authors, students, educators, marketers, editors, publishers, and professionals who use AI-assisted writing responsibly and want to improve quality rather than conceal authorship.

Why Write More Human

Traditional AI detectors offer binary labels with little explanation and no path forward. Write More Human replaces fear-driven detection with quality-driven improvement. It shows where writing can improve, explains why, and helps users make those improvements efficiently.

Running Locally

Clone the repository, install dependencies using the requirements file, and launch the application with Streamlit. Python 3.10 or newer is recommended. An OpenAI API key is required for rewriting, grammar, and paraphrasing features.

Product Direction

The current release focuses on detection, coaching, rewriting, grammar correction, paraphrasing, and exports. Planned future work includes a full web platform, user accounts, subscription plans, API access, team workflows, and enterprise-ready deployment.

Ethical Design

Write More Human is designed to improve clarity, originality, and communication quality. It is not intended to bypass academic or institutional policies. The emphasis is on better writing, clearer thinking, and more effective human communication.

Summary

Write More Human is not just an AI detector.
It is a writing improvement platform built for the age of AI-assisted authorship.
